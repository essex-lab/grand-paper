# Supplementary Material for "grand: A Python Module for Grand Canonical Water Sampling in OpenMM"

This repository contains the data and scripts necessary to reproduce the 
results presented in our manuscript, _"grand: A Python Module for Grand Canonical
Water Sampling in OpenMM"_, submitted to _J. Chem. Inf. Model._
by M. L. Samways, H. E. Bruce Macdonald and J. W. Essex (2020).

The `parameters/` directory can be used to reproduce our calculation of the excess
chemical potential and standard state volume of water, `water-density` can be
used to analyse the density of water using both GCMC/MD and NPT MD.
Finally, the `bpti` directory contains the scripts required to run the simulations
reported for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI).
Each of these directories contains a separate README describing the necessary
steps.
The _grand_ module required to run these simulations can be downloaded from
_*ADD LINK*_.

If you encounter any problems with these scripts, please contact the authors to
discuss.
